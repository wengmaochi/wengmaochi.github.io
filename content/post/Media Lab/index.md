# Introduction
This is a FPGA disparity calculator. It consists of one FPGA, one camera, and one screen. To calculate disparity map, user has to use the camera take two picture with different angles. The first picture is saved into SD RAM, 


This is the final project of NTUEE IC design Lab (EE4003).
We reference [1] for algorithm and [2] for hardware structure. After some adjustments, we implemented it in RTL level, and follow the design flow below to tape-out and testing.
