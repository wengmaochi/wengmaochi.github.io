This is the final project of NTUEE Digital Circuit Labortory (EE-3016).
In collaboration with H.L. Hsieh, Y.C. Yu.

# Introduction
This is a FPGA disparity calculator. It consists of one FPGA, one camera, and one screen. To calculate disparity map, user has to use the camera take two picture with different angles. The first picture is saved into SD RAM, 


This is the final project of NTUEE IC design Lab (EE4003).

# Introduction
The aim of this project is to implement an accelerator for Elliptic Curve Crypotography(ECC), and go through all procedure of chip manufacturing. 

We reference [1] for hardware structure and [2] for algorithm. After some adjustments, we implemented it in RTL level, and follow the design flow below to tape-out and testing.
